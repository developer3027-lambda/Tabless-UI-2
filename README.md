# Tabless-UI-2
First build week project of Lambda School. This project is an web app that allows one to save and categorize open tabs. So if you have been researching a subject and have several tabs open, you can save that tab session under a category for later review. Features a ToDo list and a calculator to help keep you organized and productive.

Pitch: People often have a million tabs up and lose track of what they were doing. This website lets you organize them in to-do lists and make a note of why it was important. Makes it easy to pick up where you left off.

 ###MVP Feature Breakdown:

 Login/Signup Pages: A mentor can login into an existing account with Username, and Password and a Phone Number or a user can sign up for an account with a username, and password and phone number. An e-mail address should be connected with an account creation.

 Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.

 Home Page: on login a user is sent to a list view page where they can see a list of their recent tabs they’ve saved, organized into categories they’ve created.

 Tab saving page: (modal or new page) User can add the link to their tab, a note about it, and a tag to organize it into an existing or new category. Clicking submit adds the tab to the correct category (or uncategorized) on the home page.
