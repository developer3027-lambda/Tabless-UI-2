# Tabless-UI-2
First build week project of Lambda School. This project is an web app that allows one to save and categorize open tabs. So if you have been researching a subject and have several tabs open, you can save that tab session under a category for later review. Features a ToDo list and a calculator to help keep you organized and productive.

You can find my [Trello](https://trello.com/b/5ff66SLs/tables-thursday) here.

#### Pitch: 
People often have a million tabs up and lose track of what they were doing. This website lets you organize them in to-do lists and make a note of why it was important. Makes it easy to pick up where you left off.

 ### MVP Feature Breakdown:

 #### Login/ Sign-up Pages: 
 A mentor can login into an existing account with Username, and Password and a Phone Number or a user can sign up for an account with a username, and password and phone number. An e-mail address should be connected with an account creation.

 #### Navigation:
 Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.

 #### Home Page: 
 on login a user is sent to a list view page where they can see a list of their recent tabs they’ve saved, organized into categories they’ve created.

 #### Tab saving page: 
 (modal or new page) User can add the link to their tab, a note about it, and a tag to organize it into an existing or new category. Clicking submit adds the tab to the correct category (or un categorized) on the home page.

 Edit a saved tab page

 #### Delete tab:
 Modal confirming the action, on confirmation user is routed back to the home page and tab is gone.

 #### Tab category page: 
 Shows a list and website preview of each tab saved, along with description user gave for that tab. Clicking the tab link takes you to that website.

 ### Stretch: 
 *A second user can login and see friends' saved tabs.*
